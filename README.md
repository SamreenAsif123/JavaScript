# JavaScript Progress Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript Progress Repository!

This repository documents my daily progress in JavaScript coding. From the humble beginnings of the 'Hello, World!' script to the ongoing development of evolving projects, you can track the growth of my JavaScript skills day by day.


Happy coding!
